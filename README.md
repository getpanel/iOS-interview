# GIPHY iOS Code Challenge

Please look at the challenge closely and make sure to cover all of the requirements.  The goal is to build a product that would reflect an app ready for production, but make sure to consider the tradeoffs necessary to complete the app in 90 minutes.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Technical Requirements
- Swift is required
- Write the app as if it was going to be part of a larger scale application by focusing on architecture and best practices
- No third party libraries
- Use any resources: Google, Stack Overflow, etc.  You'll need to explain your solution in depth, so be sure not to copy-paste

## üîç What we are looking for
- Project completeness
- Code quality: style, organization, and design
- Personal flair
- Communication, collaboration, time management, and technical excellence
- Best practices for architecture and design

Please email your Xcode project to `caleb@getpanel.dev` after the interview.

# GIPHY Requirements
- Perform asynchronous downloading and caching for GIFs
- The list needs to support pagination and infinite scrolling

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus
If you have any spare time, consider adding additional creative functionalities such as:
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements
- Dynamically sized cells (width and height) based on video dimensions
- Consider state management (empty state, loading state, offline state)
- Give the user the ability to play/pause a video based on a custom interaction
- Unit Tests
